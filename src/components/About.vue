    <h1>Basic information</h1>
    <p>Mining rewards for delegatees are calculated based on the number of verified and issued blocks, mirroring the process as if the identity was mining independently. Delegatees receive their mining rewards on a daily basis. Validation rewards are distributed 15 minutes after the end of each validation session.</p>
    <h1>Fees</h1>
    <span>The distribution of rewards follows a 92/8 split, with 92% of total rewards allocated to the delegatee and 8% to the pool owner.</span>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<span>No keys are transferred from the delegatees to the pool. Please note that the pool owner has the authority to manage delegated identities, which includes the possibility of terminating your identity and resulting in the loss of your stake. Therefore, it's crucial to delegate to pool owners you trust. Should you wish to change your delegation, you can do so in the next epoch.</span>
