        <p>Rewards for delegates are calculated based on the number of validated and proposed blocks, mirroring the process as if the identity was mining independently. The distribution of rewards follows a 90/10 split, with 90% allocated to the delegate and 10% to the pool owner. Delegates receive their rewards on a daily basis, with the countdown to the next payout displayed as: {{countdown}}.

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the potential risks associated with delegation: <link></p>
